[*SparkFun Qwiic WAV Trigger Pro (WIG-25860)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/25860)

The Qwiic WAV Trigger Pro is the latest evolution of the line of high-fidelity polyphonic audio players. The WAV Trigger Pro improves on the previous versions with a more powerful processor, enhanced MIDI processing - including velocity switching and multi-timbral support - and MIDI USB Device <b>and</b> MIDI USB Host<sup><a href="#USBMIDI_Note">[1]</a></sup> support, all in a smaller 1.75" x 1.5" footprint!

It supports up to 4096 uncompressed 16-bit, 44.1kHz mono and stereo WAV files matching CD audio quality. The WAV Trigger Pro supports polyphony and can play and mix up to 24 tracks simultaneously and independently with exceptionally low latency (2-3ms typically). Control track playback via either 8 programmable trigger inputs, I<sup>2</sup>C (Qwiic), or MIDI (USB or Serial UART). The board can function as both a USB MIDI device <i>and</i> host meaning if the WAV Trigger Pro has power in USB MIDI Host mode it can supply up to 500mA@5V to a connected MIDI device over USB-C allowing for USB MIDI control with no computer required!

Audio output is over two unbalanced channels (Left & Right). These audio outputs are only routed to a 0.1"-spaced plated through-hole (PTH) connector so some *soldering is required*.
