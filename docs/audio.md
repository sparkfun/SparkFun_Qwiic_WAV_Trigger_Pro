## Audio Assembly

The audio output of the WAV Trigger Pro is routed to three 0.1"-spaced headers labeled <b>L</b>, <b>G</b> and <b>R</b>. This requires some through-hole soldering of either wires or headers to connect to your preferred audio output. For the purposes of this guide we'll be soldering headers to these pins to connect to a [SparkFun TRRS 3.5MM Jack Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11570) to plug a pair of headphones into.

All three assembly options (Trigger, Qwiic & USB) require this step so make sure to complete this step at some point during your preferred assembly.
