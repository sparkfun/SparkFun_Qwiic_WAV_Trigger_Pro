The Qwiic WAV Trigger Pro requires a &micro;SD card to store and load WAV and Preset files. 

## Recommended SD Cards & Formats

This and other WAV Trigger boards from robertsonics interact differently with SD cards than what manufacturers typically expect. WAV Triggers rely on fast and, more importantly, reliable file access with small timeout windows. As a result, some SD cards focus more on large file transfer and . All this is to say we strongly recommend using SD cards with either a <b>FAT16</b> or <b>FAT32</b> file format. 

We do not recommend SD cards with large capacities (exFAT, etc.) as they tend to be less reliable and also can have issues formatting to work properly with the WAV Trigger.

Robertsonics has done some fairly extensive testing with his previous WAV Trigger boards and has some great write ups with a few recommendations you can read through here:

## Format SD Card

If you're using a brand new SD card, you may not need to format it though it may come with pre-installed files that could cause performance issues with the WAV Trigger Pro.
